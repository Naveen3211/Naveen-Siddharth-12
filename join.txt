A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
INNER JOIN:
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

      SELECT column_name(s)
      FROM table1
      INNER JOIN table2
      ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

LEFT JOIN:
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1
	LEFT JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

RIGHT JOIN:
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

	"SELECT column_name(s)
       FROM table1
       RIGHT JOIN table2
       ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;"

FULL JOIN:
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
	"SELECT column_name(s)
       FROM table1
       FULL OUTER JOIN table2
       ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
       WHERE condition;"
